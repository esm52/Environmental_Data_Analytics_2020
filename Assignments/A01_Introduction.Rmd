## 1) Discussion Questions

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: I've taken the Fundamentals Stats Course (R-based) as well as Dean Urban's Landscape Analysis class (R-based). I've also taken John Fay's Advanced GIS course which used Git and did some elementary coding in Python. I feel comfortable working in R but would like to learn more about coding in python and javascript (for Google Earth Engine)

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I feel confident in my ability to import data and do basic data cleaning and modeling.

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: I feel apprehensive about going back and forth between git and R studio because I am still trying to understand the structure behind the repositories and versioning. 


## 2) GitHub

Provide a link below to your forked course repository in GitHub. Make sure you have pulled all recent changes from the course repository  and that you have updated your course README file.
